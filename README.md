README

Hi there, I'm trying to build a new website for a [beach game](http://murblegame.com/) business. I don't know much about Ruby on Rails, but the fact that I already managed to create these files and change this Readme file allow me to hope I'll learn a lot in a very short time. I'm a self-learner, I like to watch a lot of training videos and you can find anything you want on the internet, you just need to have some patience and allow enough time for the learning phase.

So let me get back to work and I'm pretty sure I can get things done fast. Cheers!
